    "Activation functions are a crucial component of forward propagation in neural networks. They are applied to the weighted sum of inputs at each neuron to introduce non-linearity and allow the network to learn complex relationships in the data. The activation function determines the output of a neuron based on its input, and different activation functions serve different purposes. Here's how activation functions are used during forward propagation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Weighted Sum Calculation:**\n",

    "Solution: Implement gradient clipping, which limits the size of gradients during backpropagation. This prevents large weight updates and improves stability.\n",
    "Numerical Stability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Issue: Numerical instability can occur, especially when dealing with very small or very large values during computations.\n",
    "Solution: Implement numerical stability techniques, such as using appropriate data types (e.g., float32), normalizing inputs, and avoiding extremely large or small values.\n",
    "Choice of Activation Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Issue: The choice of activation functions may impact the training process. Some functions, like sigmoid, are prone to vanishing gradients, while others, like ReLU, may suffer from the \"dying ReLU\" problem.\n",
    "Solution: Experiment with different activation functions based on the characteristics of the data and the depth of the network. Leaky ReLU, Parametric ReLU (PReLU), or Exponential Linear Unit (ELU) are alternatives.\n",
    "Overfitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Issue: The model may overfit to the training data, capturing noise and hindering generalization to new, unseen data.\n",
    "Solution: Implement regularization techniques such as dropout, L1 or L2 regularization, and early stopping. These techniques help prevent overfitting by adding constraints to the model.\n",
    "Learning Rate Selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "Issue: An inappropriate learning rate may result in slow convergence or overshooting the minimum of the loss function.\n",
    "Solution: Experiment with different learning rates and use adaptive learning rate methods, such as Adam or RMSprop. Learning rate schedules, where the learning rate is adjusted during training, can also be beneficial.\n",
    "Local Minima:\n",
    "\n",
    "Issue: The optimization algorithm may get stuck in local minima, affecting the model's ability to find the global minimum.\n",
    "Solution: Use optimization techniques that are less likely to get stuck in local minima, such as stochastic gradient descent variants with momentum.\n",
    "Poor Initialization:\n",
    "\n",
    "Issue: Poor initialization of weights can lead to convergence issues and slow learning.\n",
    "Solution: Implement careful weight initialization methods, such as He initialization for ReLU and variants, or use pre-trained weights in transfer learning scenarios.\n",
    "Data Quality and Preprocessing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Issue: Poorly preprocessed or noisy data can adversely affect training.\n",
    "Solution: Ensure proper data preprocessing, normalization, and handling of missing values. Clean and preprocess data appropriately to improve model performance.\n",
    "Architecture Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Issue: Very complex architectures may lead to overfitting and slow training.\n",
    "Solution: Simplify the architecture or use regularization techniques. Model complexity should be chosen based on the size of the dataset and the complexity of the underlying patterns."
