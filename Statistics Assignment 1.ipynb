In other words, one extraordinarily high (or low) value in your dataset can dramatically raise (or lower) the mean.

    "The median is the middlemost number. In other words, it's the number that divides the distribution exactly in half such that half the cases are above the median, and half are below. It's also known as the 50th percentile, and it can be calculated for ordinal and interval/ratio variables. Conceptually, finding the median is fairly simple and entails only putting all of your observations in order from least to greatest and then finding whichever number falls in the middle. Note that finding the median requires first ordering all of the observations from least to greatest. This is why the median is not an appropriate measure of central tendency for nominal variables, as nominal variables have no inherent order. (In practice, finding the median can be a bit more involved, especially if you have a large number of observations—see your textbook for an explanation of how to find the median in such situations).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of you are probably already wondering, \"What happens if you have an even number of cases? There won't be a middle number then, right?\" That's a very astute observation, and I'm glad you asked. If your dataset has an even number of cases, the median is the average of the two middlemost numbers. For example, for the numbers 18, 14, 12, 8, 6 and 4, the median is 10 (12 + 8 = 20; 20/2 = 10)."

Such distributions are considered bimodal (if there are two modes) or multi-modal (if there are more than two modes). Distributions without a clear mode are said to be uniform. The mode is not particularly useful, but it is the only measure of central tendency we can use with nominal variables. "
