    "REST:-\n",
    "REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer and API stands for Application Program Interface. REST is a software architectural style that defines the set of rules to be used for creating web services. Web services which follow the REST architectural style are known as RESTful web services. It allows requesting systems to access and manipulate web resources by using a uniform and predefined set of rules. Interaction in REST based systems happen through Internet’s Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).\n",

    "5.Layered System\n",
    "6.Code on Demand\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four guidelines principle of Uniform Interface are:\n",
    "1.Resource-Based: Individual resources are identified in requests. For example: API/users.\n",
    "Manipulation of Resources Through Representations: Client has representation of resource and it contains enough information to modify or delete the resource on the server, provided it has permission to do so. Example: Usually user get a user id when user request for a list of users and then use that id to delete or modify that particular user.\n",
    "2.Self-descriptive Messages: Each message includes enough information to describe how to process the message so that server can easily analyses the request.\n",
    "3.Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS): It need to include links for each response so that client can discover other resources easily.\n",
    "SOAP:-\n",
    "he SOAP web services architecture is based on interactions between three components: a service provider, a service requester, and an optional service registry.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.The service provider\n",
    "2.The collection of software that provides a web service.\n",
    "3.The application program\n",
    "4.The middleware\n",
    "5.The platform on which they run\n",
    "6.The service requester\n",
    "7.The collection of software that is responsible for requesting a web service from a service provider.\n",
    "8.The application program\n",
    "9.The middleware\n",
    "10.The platform on which they run\n",
    "11.The service registry\n",
    "The service registry is a central location where service providers can publish their service descriptions and where service requesters can find those service descriptions.\n",
    "The registry is an optional component of the web services architecture because service requesters and providers can communicate without it in many situations. For example, the organization that provides a service can distribute the service description directly to the users of the service in a number of ways, including offering the service as a download from an FTP site.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a service registry offers a number of advantages to both the requester and provider; for example, using the IBM® WebSphere® Service Registry and Repository (WSRR) can help the requester to find services more quickly and can help the provider to enforce version control of the services being offered.\n",
    "\n",
    "CICS® provides direct support for implementing service requester and service provider components. However, you need additional software to deploy a service registry in CICS. If you use the IBM WebSphere Service Registry and Repository (WSRR), CICS provides support for WSRR through the web services assistant. Alternatively, you can deploy a service registry on another platform.\n"

    "Design:-\n",
    "The SOAP API exposes functions or operations, while REST APIs are data-driven. For example, consider an application with employee data that other applications can manipulate. The application's SOAP API could expose a function called CreateEmployee. To create an employee, you would specify the function name in your SOAP message when sending a request.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the application's REST API could expose a URL called /employees, and a POST request to that URL would create a new employee record.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility:-\n",
    "SOAP APIs are rigid and only allow XML messaging between applications. The application server also has to maintain the state of each client. This means it has to remember all previous requests when processing a new request.\n",
    "\n",
    "REST is more flexible and allows applications to transfer data as plain text, HTML, XML, and JSON. REST is also stateless, so the REST API treats every new request independently of previous requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance:-\n",
    "SOAP messages are larger and more complex, which makes them slower to transmit and process. This can increase page load times.\n",
    "\n",
    "REST is faster and more efficient than SOAP due to the smaller message sizes of REST. REST responses are also cacheable, so the server can store frequently accessed data in a cache for even shorter page load times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability:-\n",
    "The SOAP protocol requires applications to store the state between requests, which increases bandwidth and memory requirements. As a result, it makes applications expensive and challenging to scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike SOAP, REST permits stateless and layered architecture, which makes it more scalable. For example, the application server can pass the request to other servers or allow an intermediary (like a content delivery network) to handle it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Security:-\n",
    "SOAP requires an additional layer of WS-Security to work with HTTPS. WS-Security uses additional header content to ensure only the designated process in the specified server reads the SOAP message content. This adds communication overheads and negatively impacts performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "REST supports HTTPS without additional overheads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reliability:-\n",
    "SOAP has error handling logic built into it, and it provides more reliability. On the other hand, REST requires you to try again in case of communication failures, and it’s less reliable."
