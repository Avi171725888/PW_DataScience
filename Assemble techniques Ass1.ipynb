    "If you are a beginner who wants to understand in detail what is ensemble, or if you want to refresh your knowledge about variance and bias, the comprehensive article below will give you an in-depth idea of ensemble learning, ensemble methods in machine learning, ensemble algorithm, as well as critical ensemble techniques, such as boosting and bagging. But before digging deep into the what, why, and how of ensemble, let's first take a look at some real-world examples that will simplify the concepts that are at the core of ensemble learning.\n",

    "Example 1: If you are planning to buy an air-conditioner, would you enter a showroom and buy the air-conditioner that the salesperson shows you? The answer is probably no. In this day and age, you are likely to ask your friends, family, and colleagues for an opinion, do research on various portals about different models, and visit a few review sites before making a purchase decision. In a nutshell, you would not come to a conclusion directly. Instead, you would try to make a more informed decision after considering diverse opinions and reviews. In the case of ensemble learning, the same principle applies. Now let's see what ensemble means."

    "Bagging, boosting and stacking are the three most popular ensemble learning techniques. Each of these techniques offers a unique approach to improving predictive accuracy. Each technique is used for a different purpose, with the use of each depending on varying factors. Although each technique is different, many of us find it hard to distinguish between them. Knowing when or why we should use each technique is difficult."

A sample of data is first taken from the initial dataset. This sample is used to train the first model, and the model makes its prediction. The samples can either be correctly or incorrectly predicted. The samples that are wrongly predicted are reused for training the next model. In this way, subsequent models can improve on the errors of previous models"

    "Ensemble methods offer several advantages over single models, such as improved accuracy and performance, especially for complex and noisy problems. They can also reduce the risk of overfitting and underfitting by balancing the trade-off between bias and variance, and by using different subsets and features of the data. Furthermore, ensemble methods can handle different types of data and tasks, such as classification, regression, clustering, and anomaly detection, by using different types of base models and aggregation methods. Additionally, they can provide more confidence and reliability by measuring the diversity and agreement of the base models, and by providing confidence intervals and error estimates for the predictions."

    "In statistics, a confidence interval is a range of values that is used to estimate a population parameter, such as a mean, median, or variance, along with a level of confidence that the true parameter falls within that range. Bootstrap is a resampling technique used to estimate the sampling distribution of a statistic and, in turn, to calculate confidence intervals. Here's how you can calculate a confidence interval using bootstrap:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Resampling: Start with your original sample data, and create a large number of bootstrap samples by randomly sampling with replacement. Each bootstrap sample should have the same size as the original data.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Create a Sampling Distribution: After calculating the statistic for each bootstrap sample, you will have a distribution of the statistic. This distribution approximates the sampling distribution of the statistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantiles: Calculate the desired quantiles from the sampling distribution. The quantiles you choose depend on the level of confidence you want for your interval. For example, for a 95% confidence interval, you would typically calculate the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the sampling distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidence Interval: The quantiles obtained in step 4 represent the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval. You can use them to estimate the population parameter."
