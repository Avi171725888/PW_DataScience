Covariance indicates the direction of the linear relationship between variables while correlation measures both the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. Correlation is a function of the covariance. \n",
    "What sets these two concepts apart is the fact that correlation values are standardized whereas covariance values are not. \n",
    "You can obtain the correlation coefficient of two variables by dividing the covariance of these variables by the product of the standard deviations of the same values.\n",

This causes a conflict because the mean no longer provides a good representation of the data, alternatively we would much rather use the median. The median on the other hand is less likely to be affect by outliers."
