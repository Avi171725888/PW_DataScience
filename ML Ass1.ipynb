Deep learning is a key technology behind driverless cars, enabling them to recognize a stop sign, or to distinguish a pedestrian from a lamppost.

    "Unsupervised learning is when it can provide a set of unlabelled data, which it is required to analyze and find patterns inside. The examples are dimension reduction and clustering. The training is supported to the machine with the group of data that has not been labeled, classified, or categorized, and the algorithm required to facilitate on that data without some supervision. The objective of unsupervised learning is to restructure the input record into new features or a set of objects with same patterns.\n",

    "Labeled dataset is a set of data with predictors (input variables) and output (response/target variables). Supervised learning is where you have such a dataset, and you are searching for the best representative function that link or map predictors to relevant target. With availability of response variables, we are able to compare prediction and actual label, and hence modification applied to reduce misprediction and improve model.\n",
    "2.Unsupervised Learning:-\n",
    "When we have unlabeled data, we are handling unsupervised learning problem. We are clueless whether we are clustering the data points/ tuples correctly. Therefore, challenge for unsupervised learning will be deciding point to stop learning and evaluation of model built. We are not working to do any prediction here, as ‘machine’ is not taught how to predict. Instead, we are exploring and reporting underlying insights and structure of data. Three typical areas applying unsupervised learning is clustering, dimensionality reduction and association analysis.\n",
    "3.Semi-Supervised Learning:-\n",
    "This kind of learning lies in between supervised and unsupervised. It has mixture of labeled and unlabeled data with larger proportion for latter. Data available today is mostly of this form, as it is costly, time consuming, and requires expertise to get a huge data labeled. When such data is given, unsupervised learning technique is used and followed by supervised learning. Data is divided into clusters and missing labels are predicted. It is assumed that the data points in same cluster posing same or similar label, basic way to get the labels is by voting or average value among data falling in same cluster."
