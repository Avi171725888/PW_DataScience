    "Suppose we have a dataset of animals, and we want to cluster them based on their features. We have two classes of animals: mammals and birds. In this dataset, we have a total of 100 animals, with 80 mammals and 20 birds. We apply a clustering algorithm, and here's what the clustering result looks like:\n",

    "Easy Interpretation: The Silhouette Coefficient provides a single, easy-to-interpret value that quantifies the quality of clustering. A higher Silhouette score indicates better clustering quality, and a lower score suggests that the data points are not well-clustered.\n",

    "Dependence on Distance Metric: The Silhouette Coefficient's effectiveness is highly dependent on the choice of the distance metric used to measure the dissimilarity between data points.

    "Sensitivity to Cluster Shape: The Silhouette Coefficient is sensitive to the shape and size of clusters. It may not perform well when dealing with non-convex or irregularly shaped clusters, as it assumes clusters are roughly spherical in shape.\n",

    "Scalability: Computation of the Silhouette Coefficient can be computationally expensive, especially when dealing with large datasets or a high number of clusters, as it requires pairwise distance calculations.\n",

Additionally, the DBI does not take into account the structure or distribution of data, such as clusters within clusters or non-linear relationships, and only considers the pairwise distances between cluster centroids and cluster members.
